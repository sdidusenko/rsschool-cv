            <p class="about-pets-subheading">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our 
               hands and statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The
               others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for 
               a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
            <p class="about-pets-subheading-next">We feed our wards with the best food and 
               make sure that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including
               psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees
               of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter
               staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would
               hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
